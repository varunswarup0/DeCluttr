# Mascot Design

A tiny bird cheers players during milestones like long swipe combos. Keep each sprite sheet small and colorful so animations stay snappy on low-end devices.

Sprite frames live in `assets/mascot/<theme>/` with folders for `default`, `amusement`, and `horror`. Swap PNG sequences in these folders and toggle `APP_THEME` to change the look.

When you switch themes, consider using matching sound effects under `assets/sounds/<theme>/` to complete the vibe.
