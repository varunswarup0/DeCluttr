# Mascot Design

The game features a playful mascot that appears during level-up events and onboarding screens. The style should evoke the simplicity and charm of **Flappy Bird**, using chunky pixels and a bright color palette.

## Inspiration

- Short, looping flapping animation similar to Flappy Bird
- Rounded beak and simple eyes so expression is easy to read
- Keep the sprite small enough to fit next to score and XP displays

## Usage

- Trigger a quick flap animation when the user levels up
- Optionally display the mascot on the home screen or while loading photos
- Keep the sprite sheet minimal (3–4 frames) so it performs well on low-end devices

The mascot does not need to match Flappy Bird exactly—use it as a baseline for proportions and movement. A few color tweaks or accessories can help it feel unique to DeCluttr.
