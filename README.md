# DeCluttr
[![CI](https://github.com/varunswarup0/DeCluttr/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/varunswarup0/DeCluttr/actions/workflows/test.yml)

A minimal photo clean-up game for Android built with Expo React Native. A small bird mascot celebrates your progress as you swipe photos left or right. Long delete streaks unleash a playful flock animation for extra flair.
You can also move a photo into any album using the folder button.
A new WhatsApp tab lets you review images from the WhatsApp Images album.

Photos deleted in the main gallery or recycle bin are removed from the device
immediately. There is no separate trash folder beyond the in-app recycle bin,
so use caution when swiping!

Run `npm install` then `npm start` to launch the app. For full media-library access you need a development build via `expo run:android` or `eas build`.

See `docs/README.md` for an outline of the documentation including guides on audio, the mascot, onboarding, and CI.
