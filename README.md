# DeCluttr

A minimal photo clean-up game for Android built with Expo React Native. A small bird mascot celebrates your progress as you swipe photos left or right. Long delete streaks unleash a playful flock animation for extra flair.
You can also move a photo into any album using the folder button.
A new WhatsApp tab lets you review images from the WhatsApp Images album.

Run `npm install` then `npm start` to launch the app. For full media-library access you need a development build via `expo run:android` or `eas build`.

See `docs/README.md` for an outline of the documentation including guides on audio, the mascot, onboarding, and CI.
