# TODO

Future improvements and feature ideas:

- Improve selection workflow:
  - Change default swipe actions to navigate between images instead of keep/delete.
  - Optionally move the image strip to the bottom for faster navigation.
  - Provide a button to open the current photo in the system gallery for favoriting.
- Support multi-select delete of similar photos to speed up cleanup.
- Allow marking entire months or albums and bulk delete.
- Remove "Premium" label once purchased and show "Premium user" status.
- Clarify whether delete actions move to trash or permanently delete; add a setting.
- Enable scanning of WhatsApp media folders and allow advanced folder selection.
- Implement endless gallery pagination so new batches of photos load automatically. ✔️
- Add video review support and a running total of all deleted items.
- Additional nice-to-haves:
  - Mark as favourite.
  - Move or copy to a specific album.
  - Exclude or include certain albums when reviewing.
  - Detect and remove duplicate images.
  - Share images as documents or without captions.
  - Compress or resize photos.
  - Basic editing tools.
- AI-based sorting (selfies, pets, nature, etc.).
- Add dopamine-inducing animations (confetti, XP pop effects). ✔️
