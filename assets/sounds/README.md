# Sound Files for DeCluttr App

This folder should contain the following sound files:

## Required Files:

- `delete.mp3` - Sound effect played when user swipes left to delete a photo
- `keep.mp3` - Sound effect played when user swipes right to keep a photo

## Optional Files:

- `voice1.mp3` and `voice2.mp3` - short voice clips that occasionally play after deleting a photo

## File Requirements:

- Format: MP3
- Duration: 0.5-2.0 seconds recommended
- Volume: Normalized to prevent sudden loud sounds
- File size: Keep under 100KB for optimal performance

## Sound Suggestions:

- **delete.mp3**: Short "zap", "crunch", or gentle "whoosh" effect
- **keep.mp3**: Bright "coin" or "chime" sound that rewards the swipe
- For a retro vibe, keep the clips under half a second and use 8â€‘bit samples reminiscent of classic Nintendo games

## How to Add Sounds:

1. Record or download appropriate sound effects
2. Convert to MP3 format if needed
3. Place the files in this directory with the exact names above
4. The app will automatically detect and use them

## Fallback Behavior:

If sound files are not found, the app will continue to work normally without sound effects.
