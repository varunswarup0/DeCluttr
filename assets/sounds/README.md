# Sound Files

Place `delete.mp3` and `keep.mp3` in this folder to enable swipe sounds. Keep them short (under a second) and in MP3 format.

Theme variations can live in subfolders like `amusement` or `horror`. Switch `APP_THEME` to load clips from that folder, falling back to the defaults above.

Optional clips `voice1.mp3` and `voice2.mp3` play occasionally. If any file is missing the game simply runs without sound.
