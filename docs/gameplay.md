# Gameplay Overview

DeCluttr revolves around one gesture: swiping photo cards. Swipe left to delete a picture or
right to keep it. The bird mascot perched in the corner reacts with tiny hops and cheers for each action.
Long delete streaks unleash a flock of birds and a burst of confetti.

Hold a card to open the image in the system gallery. The folder button lets you move the current
photo into any album on your device. Tabs across the bottom switch between the main gallery,
videos and WhatsApp images so you can tackle clutter from multiple sources.

Haptics and short sound effects provide feedback on each swipe. Zen mode hides counters if you
prefer a distraction‑free session, while combo overlays celebrate rapid clean‑ups.
