Mascot sprite sheets live under `assets/mascot/<theme>/`. Start with the default yellow bird and swap in other folders like `amusement` or `horror` when `APP_THEME` changes.

Keep each animation shortâ€”three or four PNG frames is enough. Pair each theme with matching sounds from `assets/sounds/<theme>/` if desired.
